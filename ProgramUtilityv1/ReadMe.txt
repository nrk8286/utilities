I designed Program Utility when i could not find any application that could sart and stop multiple windows services at the same time with simple selection.Of course you could write a batch file for it but then you would have to update the batch file with the newly installed service. This utulity simplifies it. It provides the functionality to sort , filter services and start and run them in just one click ! It may contain a few bugs. You are most welcome if you want to contribute to this project.
