I wrote Program Utility when I could not find any application that could start and stop multiple windows services at the same time with simple selection.Of course you could write a batch file for it but then you would have to update the batch file with the newly installed services. This utility simplifies it. A very user friendly GUI along with the functionality to sort , filter, start an stop services in just one click ! It may contain a few bugs. You are most welcome if you want to contribute to this project.
